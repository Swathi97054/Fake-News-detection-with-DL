# Fake News Detection Analysis using DL
This project involved identifying when an article might be fake news. In this, I used a dataset named "Fake and real news‚Äù from Kaggle. I employed libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, NLTK, and Scikit-learn. I implemented a neural network like an LSTM network in this project.

# Libraries
pandas, 
numpy,
keras,
tensorflow,
scikit-learn, and 
LSTM Neural Network


# Accuracy: 99.27 (Train on 5 epochs)
